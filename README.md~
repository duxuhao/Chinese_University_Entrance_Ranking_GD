# Chinese_University_Entrance_Ranking_GD
This is a repo to predict the university admission ranking in different year

## The main questions in this project
- Can we predict the approximate admission lowest ranking of different universities?
- If we can, what parameters is related to it?
 - The admission quatities?
 - The previous admission lowest ranking?
 - The university ranking of those years?
 - The media impact of those years?
 - The ecomonic of the city?
 - The house price of the city?
 - The participate students number?

All the above variables may be able to influence the choice of each student, so that may influence the ranking. In this project, R will be used in cleaning and merging the data, doing the data pre-process like PCA and using some machinery algorithm to do the prediction. The following variables will used in analysing the data, more variables will be added:

- The university ranking
- The admission quantities
- Previous lowest admission ranking
- The GDP of the city
- The media impact

## The previous research on this topic
Not many articles are relating to this topic while the baidu education has a application to help you choosing the application university via the big data, which I think will do the prediction inside. The baidu education do not tell us how they do it. So I think I can try to do this by myself as they got a method to do it.

## Analysis chart
Several figure will be present the basic situation of the University Entrance Exam in Guangdong

- The admission population of different province variate with years
- The GDP per person in each province variate with years
- The students' population variate with years in Guangdong
- The lowest admission ranking of different universities variate with years
