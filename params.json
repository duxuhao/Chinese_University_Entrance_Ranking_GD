  "body": "# Chinese University Entrance Ranking in GuangDong\r\nThis is a repo to predict the university admission ranking in different year\r\n\r\n## The main questions in this project\r\n- Can we predict the approximate admission lowest ranking of different universities?\r\n- If we can, what parameters is related to it?\r\n - The admission quatities?\r\n - The previous admission lowest ranking?\r\n - The university ranking of those years?\r\n - The media impact of those years?\r\n - The ecomonic of the city?\r\n - The house price of the city?\r\n - The participate students number?\r\n\r\nAll the above variables may be able to influence the choice of each student, so that may influence the ranking. In this project, R will be used in cleaning and merging the data, doing the data pre-process like PCA and using some machinery algorithm to do the prediction. The following variables will used in analysing the data, more variables will be added:\r\n\r\n- The university ranking\r\n- The admission quantities\r\n- Previous lowest admission ranking\r\n- The GDP of the city\r\n- The media impact\r\n\r\n## The previous research on this topic\r\nNot many articles are relating to this topic while the baidu education has a application to help you choosing the application university via the big data, which I think will do the prediction inside. The baidu education do not tell us how they do it. So I think I can try to do this by myself as they got a method to do it.\r\n\r\n##Code book for the data description related to the China College Entrance Exam in Guangdong\r\n\r\n###File Description\r\n\r\n* ScienceAdmissionScore.xlsx -- The science admission student quantities and lowest ranking of different schools from 2010 to 2015\r\n* LiberalAdmissionScore.xlsx -- The liberal art admission student quantities and lowest ranking of different schools from 2010 to 2015\r\n* CuaaMediaRanking.xlsx -- The media impact of different schools from 2009 to 2015\r\n* CuaaQualityRanking.xlsx -- The ranking of different schools from 2009 to 2015 evaluated by CUAA\r\n* WLSQualityRanking.xlsx -- The ranking of different schools from 2009 to 2015 evaluated by WuLianShu\r\n* GDP.xlsx -- The GDP of different cities from 2009 to 2015\r\n* HousePrice.xlsx -- The house price of different cities",
